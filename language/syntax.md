## Simple Guide To Programming In Zahl

### Zahl source file naming
* Every Zahl source file must have the file extension .zahl
* The name of each source file should be written in lower_snake_case, and no numbers should be used.

### Structure of a Zahl source file
* Every Zahl source file consists of include statements, function definitions, comments and nothing else.
* Zahl source files can only be run if they contain exactly one start function.

### The include keyword
* The include keyword should be followed by the name of a Zahl source file.
* All functions in the included file will then be available to the functions in the present file.
* Include statements should appear at the top of the source file.
* The included files should not contain a start function.
